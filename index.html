		<h3 class="subtitle">Collages</h3>
		<p id="oak"> To the right is a collage, <i>OAK</i>, I originally created with paper and later scanned and digitally altered using Photoshop. The background and circle were cut out of a 1960's <i>Life</i> magazine, and the "Oak" text was cut from a luggage tag flying to Oakland International Airport fifteen minutes from my childhood home in California.</p>

		<h3 class="subtitle">Poetry</h3>
		<p id="poetry">

			<u>muscle</u><br>

i went walking in my stone<br>
back to the white stripe<br>
the milk in the shallow<br>
past of me<br>

each time i visit<br>
oaxaca seems more<br>
and more martian<br>

the jacaranda<br>
growing lower<br>
weaves its root into dirt<br>

there is a light stepping over<br>
my feet<br>
stepping over <br>
the cobblestone<br>
</p>
