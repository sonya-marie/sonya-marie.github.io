    <h1>Swipe it Forward: The Hidden Legal Loophole of the MTA</h1>
    <h2>by Sonya Lustig, September 25th, 2019</h2>
  </div>

<p id= "graph1">If you’ve ever stepped foot on a New York City subway, chances are you’ve either been asked for money to pay the train fare or been the one asking. You’ve probably never been told, however, that anyone can use an unlimited ride pass to pay for another passenger without looking over their shoulder for NYPD. Why? Because it’s completely legal.</p>
<p id= "graph2">Public ads warning passengers of payment violation consequences, such as a $100 fine or even arrest, have developed an <a href="https://new.mta.info/transparency/financial-information/financial-and-budget-statements"target=”_blank”>increased presence</a> in subway-cars and stations across the city since the beginning of 2019 when the <a href="http://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-headquarters/mta-board-adopts-new-fares-and-tolls-holds-base-subway-bus"target=”_blank”>subway fare increased from $2.50 to $2.75.</a> Blunt messages such as 
<blockquote id="bq1">“We’re stepping up fare evasion enforcement. Don’t get a ticket. Please pay the fare”</blockquote> <p id="graph22">are printed in bold black and purple lettering and posted as many as four times in a single subway car.</p> 
<p id="graph3"> Ben Shields, a 22-year-old freelance designer, uses his unlimited ride pass to swipe-in other riders nearly every day. He ignores the city-funded warnings. Skeptical of the claim that N.Y.P.D. is actually issuing more fare evasion tickets and arrests than in prior years, Shields questions “Are they really, or are they just saying that?”</p>

<p id="ticket">A $100 fare evasion fine, partially covered by a MetroCard.</p>


<p id="graph4"> They aren’t “Just saying that.” According to N.Y.P.D.’s own data, the police department issued a <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/subway-fare-evasion.page"target=”_blank”>15,820 summonses between April and June of 2019,</a> compared to only <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/subway-fare-evasion.page"target=”_blank”> 9,692 during the same period last year.</a> Black or Latino <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/crime-enf.page"target=”_blank”>riders</a> made up 71 percent of fare evasion tickets and 86 percent of fare evasion arrests within this three-month window.</p>

<p id="graph5">Though it was in December of 2016 that <a href="https://twitter.com/swipeitforward/status/804880044233523200"target=”_blank”>Swipe it Forward was founded,</a> Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo’s recent investment in  <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/budget/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/056-NYPD-2020.pdf"target=”_blank”>500 new fare evasion enforcement officers</a> to be included in the city’s 2019 budget proves the issue is as urgent as ever. Swipe it Forward, No New Jails NYC, and Rider Alliance continue to assert that fare evasion enforcement disproportionately targets New Yorkers of color and needs to be combated by both the city’s government and civilians alike. Though lobbying has been and remains to be extensively pursued by these organizations, Swipe It Forward’s approach relies entirely on community action and outreach.</p>
<p id="graph6">Shannon Lee and a group of five to ten other swipe-sharing advocates can regularly be found in New York City’s most populated subway stations, Atlantic Avenue, Times Square, and 125th Street to name a few, encouraging people to donate their swipes in the midst of commuter chaos. Repeating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Sr3E3UlLLQ"target=”_blank”>attention-grabbing chants </a> such as</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote2"> “Being Black is not a crime! Being Brown is not a crime! Being Poor is not a crime!” and “Real New Yorkers swipe it forward,”</blockquote> 



<p id=graph7>the activists are even harder to ignore than the fare-evasion ads and beat cops lingering just a few feet away.</p>
<p id="graph8">Each turned head in the crowded subway stations which Swipe it Forward occupies is handed an 8 ½’’ x 11’’ sheet of paper. The top of each flyer advises “It’s legal: Swipe someone in with your Metrocard at the end of your ride,” followed by a list of statistics and calls to action, such as “Together we can stop the NYPD from criminalizing poverty. No one should go to jail for not having $2.75.”</p>
<p id="graph9">After years of consistent outreach on behalf of Swipe It Forward and like-minded organizations, fare evasion politics have earned a place in today’s discussion of mass incarceration and institutional racism. Though more awareness means more swipe-sharing, it also means more police intervention. Increasingly aware of unlimited swipe legality, which isn’t an actual piece of legislation but rather an omission presented by the fact that <a href="http://web.mta.info/metrocard/termsunltd.htm"target=”_blank”>the action is never explicitly condemned by law,</a> the NYPD has found its own loophole in terms of preventing the exchange.</p>

<p id="graph10">Though using an unlimited ride Metrocard to swipe in another passenger after 18 minutes is legal, asking for a swipe is not, and can be punishable by a fine of $25 to $50, after <a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/rules/TransitAdjudicationBureau/rules.htm"target=”_blank”>arrest for the offense was outlawed in 2016.</a> For now, Swipe it Forward advises unlimited Metrocard holders to ask other riders if they need a swipe, as opposed to waiting to be asked.</p>

<p id="graph11">Just as those who struggle to pay the subway’s increased fare, the MTA continues to face financial obstacles of its own. <a href="http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/docs/NYCT-Metrics-Report.pdf"target=”_blank”>Last year the MTA lost $225 million to fare evasion, over double the $110 million lost in 2015.</a> Without the significant NYPD crackdown on fare evasion, it’s unlikely that the pattern would’ve changed on its own. While government officials like Cuomo maintain that the fare must be paid, many New Yorkers are still left questioning the true cost of a Metrocard, and more importantly, if it’s really worth it.</p>
